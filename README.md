# Dominator
 
An array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the value   
that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.  
  
For example, consider array A such that  
  
 A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3  
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1  
 A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3  
The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A   
(namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.
